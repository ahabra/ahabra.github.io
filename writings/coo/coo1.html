    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Are you a C programmer and want to use some of the Object Oriented (OO) programming techniques but don't have the
      time to learn C++ or C++ simply is not available in your programming environment, this article will show you how
      to
      use C to get started. (Note: This article assumes that you already know C and understand the basic OO concepts.)
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
    <p>
      This section provides a quick summary of some Object Oriented concepts and serves as a reminder of some C
      constructs.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Encapsulation</b>: To hide the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Inheritance</b>: To create a new class by adding new characteristics to a base class to form a derived class.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Polymorphism</b>: Derived classes of a base class receive and respond to the same message, but their response
        may be different.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Function Pointer</b>: Holds the address of a function of a certain type. e.g.,
        <code>int (*foo)()</code> means that <code>foo</code> points to a
        function that returns an integer. Let's say we have the following function:
        <pre class="code">int square(int x) { return x*x; }</pre>
        We could assign the address of <code>square</code> to <code>foo</code>:
        <pre class="code">foo = square;</pre>
        Now if we have <code>n</code> as an integer, we can say:
        <pre class="code">n= foo(3);
<i>/* n is 9 now */</i></pre>

        Notice how calling <code>foo()</code> is equivalent to calling
        <code>square()</code>. Understanding the concepts of function pointers is important to understand
        the following sections.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Class Definition</h3>
    To define a class just declare a <code>typedef struct</code> that contains all the members needed, e.g.,
    <pre class="code">typedef struct { ... } MyClass;</pre>
    Methods are defined as function pointer class members. Let's define a simple class that stores a distance quantity
    in miles:

    <pre class="code">
typedef struct {
  float DistanceMiles;
  float (*DistanceKm)();
  /* get the distance in KiloMeters */
} DISTANCE;</pre>
    <p>
      Notice that <code>DistanceKm</code> is just a pointer to a function that returns a <code>float</code>.
    </p>
    <P>
      Now you may wonder where the actual implementation of <code>DistanceKm</code> is, so let's
      define this function:
    </P>
    <pre class="code">
float DistanceKm(DISTANCE* this) {
  return this->DistanceMiles*1.609;
}</pre>

    <p>
      This function takes an argument that is a pointer to <code>DISTANCE</code> class and uses its
      <code>DistanceMiles</code> member to find the distance in Km. Notice that till now we didn't
      define any object (variable) of type
      <code>DISTANCE</code> because the class is just a declaration. In order to create an object of
      this class, just allocate some memory for it on the heap:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">DISTANCE* ob= (DISTANCE*) calloc(1, sizeof(DISTANCE));</pre>

    Additionally, we need to assign the function pointer member in <code>ob</code> to the address of
    <code>DistanceKm()</code> function:

    <pre class="code">ob-&gt;DistanceKm= DistanceKm;</pre>

    <p>
      Notice that allocating the memory and initializing the function pointer needs to be done for every object of the
      class once it is created.
      Sounds like a <i>constructor</i>, doesn't it? So let's create a constructor function that create and initialize
      an object of type <code>DISTANCE</code> and returns its address:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">DISTANCE* ConstructDistance() {
  DISTANCE* ob= (DISTANCE*) calloc(1, sizeof(DISTANCE));
  ob->DistanceKm= DistanceKm;
  return ob;
}</pre>

    <p>
      You may wonder why didn't we make the <code>ConstructDistance()</code> a member of the
      <code>DISTANCE</code> class, and the answer is that we can't call a member function, i.e.
      method, before creating and initializing the class, which is what the function
      <code>ConstructDistance()</code> does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a constructor that allocates memory on the heap calls for a <I>destructor</I> that will free this memory.
      The following is such a destructor:
    </p>

    <pre class="code">void Destructor(DISTANCE** this) {
  free(*this);
  *this= 0;
}</pre>

    <p>
      The <code>Destructor()</code> is called after an object is created when it is no longer needed.
      This implies that the <code>Destructor()</code> can be a member function of the class defined like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">void (*Destructor)();</pre>

    Its address has to be initialized in the constructor:
    <pre class="code">this-&gt;Destructor= Destructor;</pre>

    In order to call the <code>Destructor()</code>:
    <pre class="code">ob-&gt;Destructor(&amp;ob);</pre>

    Next is the final definition of the class and its constructor:
    <pre class="code">typedef struct {
  float DistanceMiles;
  float (*DistanceKm)();
  void (*Destructor)();
} DISTANCE;

DISTANCE* ConstructDistance() {
  DISTANCE* ob= (DISTANCE*) calloc(1, sizeof(DISTANCE));
  ob->DistanceKm= DistanceKm;
  ob->Destructor= Destructor;
  return ob;
}</pre>

    If you actually compile the above code you may need to put <i>prototypes</i> for the member functions -methods-
    before the constructor.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    This article showed how to define a class, and create and destroy objects of this class. In a next article I will
    show
    how to implement encapsulation and how to define private and public members of a class. If there is interest I will
    show how to implement inheritance, polymorphism and templates. For those who want more challenging reading I could
    elaborate on how to make dynamic objects; i.e., objects that can have their definition changed at run-time. And for
    those who want more thought provoking tips, I could show how to distribute these objects; i.e., where objects of a
    class do not have to be in the same process or even on the same machine.
