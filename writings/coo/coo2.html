    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <P>
      This is the second article in a series on Object Oriented programming techniques using C. In the previous
      installment of this series of articles I explained how to use C to define a class. The
      <code>DISTANCE</code> class was used as an example. In this installment
      <i>encapsulation</i> will be presented including how to define public and private members of a class.
      Encapsulation is the ability to hide the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world.
    </P>
  </section>


  <section>
    <h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
    This section provides a brief explanation of some C constructs that will be used later to support encapsulation.

    <h4>Static Functions</h4>
    <p>
      A static function is a function that is only visible in the file that contains it. A static function is defined
      by adding the word<code>static</code> at the beginning of the function definition. For example, if we have a
      file called <code>test1.c</code> that has the function:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">static int square(int x) { return x*x; }</pre>

    then the only functions that can use<code>square()</code> are functions defined in the file
    <code>test1.c</code>.

    <h4>Casting</h4>
    Casting provides the ability to convert a value to a different type. To cast an expression, put the target data
    type in parentheses directly before the expression. For example:

    <pre class="code">float x;
x= (float) 1;</pre>


    assigns the<code>int</code> value 1 to the<code>float</code> variable <code>x</code>.
    In the previous installment we used casting in the constructor:

    <pre class="code">DISTANCE* ob=(DISTANCE*) calloc(1, sizeof(DISTANCE));</pre>

    <p>
      The<code>calloc()</code> function returns a<code>void</code> pointer, and we cast it to
      <code>DISTANCE</code> pointer in order to assign this value to
      <code>ob</code> without the compiler generating any warning messages.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summary, if we have the cast:<code>(MyType)MyValue</code> we will be telling the compiler
      to treat <code>MyValue</code> as if it is of type <code>MyType</code>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    We need to have a facility in which the methods of a class can only be accessed through the class.
    Additionally, the class may have members that should not be visible outside the class definition, i.e.
    <i>private</i>.

    <h4>Methods Scope</h4>
    For a class, only its definition should be visible by the class' users. The implementation of the class should be
    completely hidden. The solution is simple:

    <ol>
      <li>Put the class definition in a <i>header</i> file <code>FileName.h</code></li>
      <li>Put a <i>prototype</i> for the constructor in the header file.</li>
      <li>Put the class implementation in a <i>source</i> file <code>FileName.c</code></li>
      <li>Define all the methods (except the constructor) in the source file to be <I>static</I>.</li>
      <li>Now, whenever you want to use the class, include its header file.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      For our<code>DISTANCE</code> class,
      put the class definition (i.e. <code>struct</code>) in<code>distance.h</code>,
      put the implementation of its methods in <code>distance.c</code>
      and make all the methods <i>static</i> (except <code>ConstructDistance</code>). For example:
    </p>

    <pre class="code">static float DistanceKm(DISTANCE* this) {
  return this->DistanceMiles*1.609;
}</pre>


    <h4>Private Members</h4>
    Although the class implementation is hidden from its users, all the class members are accessible by anyone who
    this class. We need to have a mechanism in which some of the class's members are inaccessible by the class users.
    In our <code>DISTANCE</code> class, suppose we want to be able to <i>set</i> and
    <i>get</i> the distance in both units of Miles or Kilometer.

    <ol>
      <li>To start, define the class definition as follows:
        <h5>distance.h</h5>
        <pre class="code">typedef struct {
  void* private;
  void (*Destructor)();
  void (*SetMiles)();
  float (*GetMiles)();
  void (*SetKm)();
  float (*GetKm)();
} DISTANCE;
DISTANCE* ConstructDistance();</pre>
        Notice that there is no data member to store the distance value in the class definition.
        Additionally, there is a <code>void</code> pointer named <code>private</code>.
      </li>

      <li>Create the following type in <code>distance.c</code>
        <pre class="code">
typedef struct {
  float DistanceMiles;
} PrivateType;</pre>
        Put in this<code>PrivateType</code> all the class members that you wish to make private.
      </li>

      <li>In the <I>constructor</I>, assign the class member<code>private</code> to a memory
        allocated type, <code>PrivateType</code>:
        <pre class="code">ob->private= calloc(1, sizeof(PrivateType));</pre>
      </li>

      <li>Update the <i>destructor</i> to free <code>private</code>:
        <pre class="code">free((*this)->private);</pre>
      </li>

      <li>Methods of the class can access <code>DistanceMiles</code> as a member in a casted
        <code>private</code>, for example:
        <pre class="code">
static void SetMiles(DISTANCE* this, float miles) {
  PrivateType* p= (PrivateType*)this->private;
  p->DistanceMiles= miles;
}</pre>
        Notice how<code>private</code> -which is a void pointer- is <i>casted</i> to
        a<code>PrivateType</code> pointer.
      </li>

      <li>Remember to have <code>DISTANCE* this</code> as the first argument of every method.</li>
      <li>If anybody uses the<code>DISTANCE</code> class, they can not access the contents of
        <code>PrivateType</code> because it is defined in <code>distance.c</code>
      </li>
      <li>Although the class has a public member <code>private</code>, this member is only a void
        pointer. The user of the class has no way of accessing the contents of this private without
        accessing the source file <code>distance.c</code></li>
      <li>The only discipline required from the class user is not to change the value of
        <code>private</code> after the class construction.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    It is shown here that with utilizing some standard C constructs we are capable of supporting encapsulation. This
    is achieved with a simple approach. Mainly, define all methods implementation to be static and have a class member
    that the user can not change (private). In the next installment of this series of articles, I will discuss
    inheritance and polymorphism then see if we could implement them using C.
