    <h3 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>A Neural Network (NN) is a computer software (and possibly hardware) that
      simulates a simple model of neural cells in animals and humans. The purpose of
      this simulation is to acquire the <i>intelligent</i> features of these cells. In this
      document, when terms like <i>neuron, neural network, learning, or experience</i> are
      mentioned, it should be understood that we are using them only in the context of
      a NN as computer system.</p>

    <p>NNs have the ability to learn by example, e.g. a NN can be trained to
      recognize the image of car by showing it many examples of a car.</p>

    <p>We will discuss neurons, NNs in general, and Back Propagation networks. Back
      Propagation networks are a popular type of network that can be trained to
      recognize different patterns including images, signals, and text.</p>

    <p>This article does not try to prove the usefulness of NNs, when they should be
      used, or why do they work. It is a high level summary with emphasize on how Back
      Propagation networks work.</p>
  </section>

    <h3 id="History">2. History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Serious research started in the 1950s and 1960s by researchers like
        Rosenblatt (Perceptron), Widrow and Hoff (ADALINE).
      </li>
      <li>In 1969 Minsky and Papert wrote a book exposing Perceptron limitations.
        This effectively ended the interest in neural network research.
      </li>
      <li>In the late 1980s interest in NN increased with algorithms like Back
        Propagation, Cognitrons and Kohonen. (Many of them where developed quietly
        during the 1970s)
      </li>
      <li>Progress continued during the 1990ís.</li>
      <li>Currently NNs are used in many commercial applications like character
        recognition, image recognition, credit evaluation, fraud detection,
        insurance, and stock forecasting.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="SigmoidFunction">3. Sigmoid Function</h3>
    The function:
    <pre class="code formula">s(x) = 1 / (1 + e <sup>-a * x</sup>)</pre>

    <p>is called a Sigmoid function. The coefficient <code>a</code> is a real number constant.
      Usually in NN applications <code>a</code> is chosen between 0.5 and 2. As a starting
      point, you could use <code>a = 1</code> and modify it later when you are fine-tuning the
      network. Note that <code>s(0)= 0.5</code>,
      <code>s(&#8734;)= 1</code>, <code>s(-&#8734;)=0</code>.
      (The symbol <code>&#8734;</code> means <i>infinity</i>).</p>
    <p>Think of the sigmoid function, in layman terms, as a function that will
      convert values less than 0.5 to 0, and values greater than 0.5 to 1. The Sigmoid
      function is used on the output of neurons as will be explained next.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="Neuron">4. Neuron</h3>
    <p>In a NN context, a neuron is a model of a neural cell in animals and humans.
      This model is simplistic, but as it turned out, is very practical. Think of the
      neuron as a program (<i>or a class if you like</i>) that has one
      or more inputs and produces one output. The inputs simulate the stimuli/signals
      that a neuron gets, while the output simulates the response/signal which the
      neuron generates. The output is calculated by multiplying each input by a
      different number (called weight), adding them all together, then scaling the
      total to a number between 0 and 1.</p>
    <p>The following diagram shows a simple neuron with:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Three inputs [x1, x2, x3]. The input values are usually scaled to values
        between 0 and 1.
      </li>
      <li>Three input weights [w1, w2, w3]. The weights are real numbers that
        usually are initialized to some random numbers. Do not let the term <i>
          weight</i> mislead you, it has nothing to do with the physical sense of
        weight, in a programmer context, think of the weight as a variable of type
        float/real that you can initialize to a random number between 0 and 1.
      </li>
      <li>One output z. A neuron has one (and only one) output. Its value is
        between 0 and 1, it can be scaled to the full range of actual values.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <figure>
      <img src="neuron.gif" alt="Neuron with three inputs">
      <figcaption>Neuron with three inputs</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Let
    <pre class="code formula"> d= (x1 * w1) + (x2 * w2) + (x3 * w3)</pre>

    In a more general fashion, for n number of inputs:
    <pre class="code formula">d= Sum(x<sub>i</sub> * w<sub>i</sub>)            <i>... for i=1 to n</i></pre>
    or more formally:
    <pre class="code formula">d= &Sigma; x<sub>i</sub> w<sub>i</sub>           <i>... for i=1 to n</i></pre>

    Let <code class="code formula">q</code> be a real number which we will call <i>Threshold</i>.
    Experiments have shown that best values for q are between 0.25 and 1.
    Again, in a programmer context, q is just a variable of type float/real that is
    initialized to any number between 0.25 and 1.

    <pre class="code formula">z= s(d + q)      <i>... Apply the sigmoid to get a number between 0 and 1</i></pre>

    This says that the output <code class="code formula">z</code> is the result of applying the sigmoid
    function on <code class="code formula">(d + q)</code>.
    In NN applications, the challenge is to find the right values for the weights and the threshold.

    <h3 id="NeuralNetworks">5. Neural Networks</h3>
    <p>
      A neural network is a group of neurons connected together. Connecting neurons to form
      a NN can be done in various ways, next are some examples:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="networks.gif" alt="Neural Networks examples">
      <figcaption>Neural Networks examples</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>
      One of the popular NN is called the <i>Back Propagation</i> network which will be discussed next.
    </p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <h3 id="BackPropagationNetworks">6. Back Propagation Networks</h3>
    <p>
      The following diagram shows a Back Propagation NN:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="backProp.gif" alt="Back Propagation Network">
      <figcaption>Back Propagation Network</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <br>
    <p>This NN consists of three layers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Input layer with three neurons.</li>
      <li>Hidden layer with two neurons.</li>
      <li>Output layer with two neurons.</li>
    </ol>

    Note that:
    <ol>
      <li>The output of a neuron in a layer goes to all neurons in the following layer.</li>
      <li>Each neuron has its own input weights.</li>
      <li>The weights for the input layer are assumed to be 1 for each input. In
        other words, input values are not changed.
      </li>
      <li>The output of the NN is reached by applying input values to the input
        layer, passing the output of each neuron to the following layer as input.
      </li>
      <li>The Back Propagation NN must have at least an input layer and an output
        layer. It could have zero or more hidden layers.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The number of neurons in the input layer depends on the number of possible
      inputs we have, while the number of neurons in the output layer depends on the
      number of desired outputs. The number of hidden layers and how many neurons in
      each hidden layer cannot be well defined in advance, and could change per
      network configuration and type of data. In general the addition of a hidden
      layer could allow the network to learn more complex patterns, but at the same
      time decreases its performance. You could start a network configuration using a
      single hidden layer, and add more hidden layers if you notice that the network
      is not learning as well as you like.</p>

    <p>For example, suppose we have a bank credit application with ten questions,
      which based on their answers, will determine the credit amount and the interest
      rate. To use a Back Propagation NN, the network will have ten neurons in the
      input layer and two neurons in the output layer.</p>

    <section>
      <h4>6.1 Supervised Training</h4>
      <p>The Back Propagation NN works in two modes, a supervised training mode and a
        production mode. The training can be summarized as follows:</p>
      <p>
        Start by initializing the input weights for all neurons to some random numbers between 0 and 1, then:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Apply input to the network.</li>
        <li>Calculate the output.</li>
        <li>Compare the resulting output with the desired output for the given
          input. This is called the <i>error</i>.
        </li>
        <li>Modify the weights and threshold <code>q</code> for all neurons using the
          <i>error</i>.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat the process until <i>error</i> reaches an acceptable value (e.g.
          <i>error</i> &lt; 1%), which means that the NN was trained successfully, or if we reach a
          maximum count of iterations, which means that the NN training was not
          successful.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>The challenge is to find a good algorithm for updating the weights and
        thresholds in each iteration (step 4) to minimize the <i>error</i>.</p>

      <p>Changing weights and threshold for neurons in the output layer is different
        from hidden layers. Note that for the input layer, weights remain constant at 1
        for each input neuron weight.</p>

      <p>Before we explain the training, let's define the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><code>l</code> (<i>Lambda</i>) the Learning Rate: a real
          number constant, usually 0.2 for output layer neurons and 0.15 for hidden
          layer neurons.
        </li>
        <li><code>D</code> (<i>Delta</i>) the change: For example <code>Dx</code>
          is the change in x. Note that <code>Dx</code> is a
          single value and not <code>D</code> multiplied by <code>x</code>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>6.2 Output Layer Training</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Let z be the output of an output layer neuron as shown in section 4.</li>
        <li>Let y be the desired output for the same neuron, it should be scaled to
          a value between 0 and 1. This is the ideal output which we like to get when
          applying a given set of input.
        </li>
        <li>Then e (the <i>error</i>) will be:</li>
      </ol>
      <pre class="code">
e = z * (1 – z) * (y – z)
Dq = l * e                 ... The change in q
Dwi = Dq * xi              ... The change in weight at input i of the neuron</pre>

      <p>In other words, for each output neuron, calculate its error e, and then
        modify its threshold and weights using the formulas above.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>6.3 Hidden Layer Training</h4>
      <p>Consider a hidden layer neuron as shown in the following figure:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="hiddenLayer.gif"  alt="Hidden Layer neuron">
        <figcaption>Hidden Layer neuron</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <br/>

      <ul>
        <li>Let <code>z</code> be the output of the hidden layer neuron as shown in section 4.</li>
        <li>Let <code>m<sub>i</sub></code> be the weight at neuron
          <code>N<sub>i</sub></code> in the layer following the current
          layer. This is the weight for the input coming from the current hidden layer
          neuron.</li>
        <li>Let <code>e<sub>i</sub></code> be the error (e) at neuron
          <code>N<sub>i</sub></code>.</li>
        <li>Let <code>r</code> be the number of neurons in the layer following the current layer.
          (In the above diagram r=3).</li>
      </ul>

      <pre class="code">
g = S m<sub>i</sub> * e<sub>i</sub>                <i>... (for i=1 to r)</i>
e = z * (1 – z) * g          <i>... Error at the hidden layer neuron</i>
Dq = l * e                   <i>... The change in q</i>
Dw<sub>i</sub> = Dq * x<sub>i</sub>                <i>... The change in weight i</i></pre>

      <p>
        Notice that in calculating <code>g</code>, we used the weight<code>m<sub>i</sub></code> and
        error <code>e<sub>i</sub></code> from the following layer, which means that the error and weights in
        this following layer should have already been calculated.
        This implies that during a training iteration of a Back Propagation NN, we start
        modifying the weights at the output layer, and then we proceed backwards on the hidden
        layers one by one until we reach the input layer.
        It is this method of proceeding backwards which gives this network its name Backward Propagation.

    <h3 id="Conclusion">7. Conclusion</h3>
    <p>NNs are being used in many businesses and applications. Their ability to
      learn by example is very attractive in environments where the <i>business rules</i>
      are either not well defined or are hard to enumerate and define.</p>

    <p>You may wander about the formulae and constants values, why did we do this or
      choose that. That's good but beyond the scope of this article. Check some of the
      resources for more details.</p>
