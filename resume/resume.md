  investment, ...
* Upgraded system to use simpler architecture and less code. This saved on cost of upgrades and
  maintenance.
* Technologies used, Java 8, Spring, maven, JavaScript, React, Webpack, Cypress.

#### Senior Researcher in the Advanced Technology/ R&D Group

* Created a system for multi-factor authentication using biometrics.
* Created a system for high speed multi-client messaging.
* Created a system for real-time monitoring of social networking. Used NLP and Sentiment analysis
  for early detection of TDA systems issues.
